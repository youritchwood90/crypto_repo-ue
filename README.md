This repo contains my implementations of several key cryptographic elements, including common cryptosystems and attacks.

### Current contents:
- Symmetric: AES128 implementation
  - GF(2^8) finite field operations

### Future contents:
- Symmetric: AES128 w/ CBC, CTR modes
  - Padding oracle attack
  - Key schedule reversal attack
- Asymmetric: DHKE
  - MITM attack
- Asymmetric: RSA
  - Small plaintext attack
- Assymetric: ElGamal
- RSA signatures
- Elliptic curves?
